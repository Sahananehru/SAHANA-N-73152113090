     <P>Today, the term “AI” describes a wide range of technologies that power many of the services and goods we use every day 
        <br>– from apps that recommend tv shows to chatbots that provide  customer support in real time. But do all of these really
        <br> constitute artificial intelligence as most of us envision it? And if not, then why do we use the term so often? 
        In <br>this article, you’ll learn more about artificial intelligence, what it actually does, and different types of it.
        <br> In the end, you’ll also learn about some of its benefits and dangers and explore flexible courses that can help you
        <br> expand your knowledge of AI even further.  </P>
